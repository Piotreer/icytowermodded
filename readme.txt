When your wondering why does a shortcut doesent show on my desktop its thanks to nsis(the software i created the installer in)
its limited installer making gui doesent have an option to create a shortcut on your desktop so to make a shortcut or run it go to c:\icytower151 and run the exe or to make a shortcut click on your desktop and select shortcut
then go to the file directory and select it and follow the steps.
Enjoy!
