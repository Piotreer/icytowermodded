When your wondering why does a shortcut doesent show on my desktop its thanks to nsis(the software i created the installer in)
its limited installer making gui doesent have an option to create a shortcut on your desktop so to make a shortcut or run it go to c:\icytower151 and run the exe or to make a shortcut click on your desktop and select shortcut
then go to the file directory and select it and follow the steps.
Enjoy!
the place where you download it is https://www.mediafire.com/file/3fje76bx6z4r9ul/icytowermodded.exe/file
github limited the upload size to 25 mb so you need to download it from mediafire
